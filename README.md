  ### [UBC Rocket - Thrust Vector Rocket](https://www.ubcrocket.com)
  I am currently contributing to UBC Rocket's self-landing rocket project, the Thrust Vector Rocket, as the project manager and controls lead. Our current algorithm utilizes PID control for precise stabilization and Kalman filtering for accurate state estimation.

  **Achievement**: Second Place, Technology Demonstration Category at Launch Canada 2024, Canada's premier rocketry competition featuring over 400 participants from 25 universities.


  ### [Personal Blog](https://github.com/Shengw3n/Shengw3n.github.io)
  - My personal blog where I share my weekly reports and various engineering adventures
  - Developed in JavaScript using the NodeJS powered Hexo framework with the Fluid theme
  - Deployed via GitHub Pages @ [shengw3n.github.io](https://shengw3n.github.io)
