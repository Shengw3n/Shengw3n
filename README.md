  ### [UBC Rocket - Thrust Vector Rocket](https://www.ubcrocket.com)
  I am currently contributing to UBC Rocket's self-landing rocket project, the Thrust Vector Rocket, as the project manager and controls lead. Our current algorithm utilizes PID control to ensure stable and accurate thrust vectoring for hovering and precision landing.

  ### [Personal Blog](https://github.com/Shengw3n/Shengw3n.github.io)
  - My personal blog where I share my weekly reports and various engineering adventures
  - Developed in JavaScript using the NodeJS-based [Hexo framework](https://hexo.io/index.html) with the [Fluid theme](https://hexo.fluid-dev.com/docs/en/)
  - Deployed via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) @ [shengw3n.github.io](https://shengw3n.github.io)
