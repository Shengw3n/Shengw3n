  #### [FPGA RISC Machine](https://github.com/Shengw3n/FPGA-Reduced-Instruction-Set-Computer)
  - **Languages and tools:** SystemVerilog, Quartus, ModelSim, FPGA (DE1-SoC Board)
  - Implemented a Turing Complete 16-bit RISC machine using System Verilog on an FPGA board
  - Modular design with smaller modules such as ALU, controller, datapath, regfile, and shifter 
  - Utilized ModelSim and Quartus for thorough verification and FPGA deployment on a DE1-SoC board

  #### [Metal Detector Robot](https://github.com/Shengw3n/Remote-Controlled-Metal-Detector-Robot)
  - **Languages and tools:** C, STM32 microcontroller, EFM8 microcontroller
  - Developed in C a battery-powered, remote-controlled robot capable of detecting metals
  - Integrated a metal detector with real-time strength display and audio alerts via a remote controller
  - Implemented autonomous driving capabilities and user interface for remote operation
    
  #### [Reflow Oven Controller](https://github.com/Shengw3n/Reflow-Oven-Controller)
  - **Languages and tools:** Assembly, Python, 8051 Microcontroller
  - Developed in assembly a Reflow Oven Controller for surface mount device soldering
  - Implemented temperature measurement and control with an 8051 microcontroller and a K-type thermocouple
  - Developed an interface with an LCD display and pushbuttons for user interaction as well as email notifications

  ### [UBC Rocket - Thrust Vector Rocket](https://www.ubcrocket.com)
  I am currently contributing to UBC Rocket's self-landing rocket project, the Thrust Vector Rocket, as the project manager and firmware lead. Our current algorithm utilizes PID control for precise stabilization and Kalman filtering for accurate state estimation.

  **Achievement**: Second Place, Technology Demonstration Category at Launch Canada 2024, Canada's premier rocketry competition featuring over 400 participants from 25 universities.
